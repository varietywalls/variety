Description: Wallpaper changer, downloader and manager
 Variety is an open-source wallpaper changer, downloader, and manager for
 Linux. It supports a variety of sources for wallpapers, including local

 functionality on certain desktop setups:
  * feh | nitrogen: used for wallpaper changing on i3-wm, Openbox, and dwm
  * gnome-shell-extension-top-icons-plus: adds indicators support to GNOME
    Shell, so that Variety's tray icon can be displayed
