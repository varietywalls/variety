# Variety

Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports out-of-the-box most Linux desktop environments, and can be configured to work 
on more esoteric ones.

It can use local images or automatically download wallpapers from Flickr, Wallhaven, Unsplash, Bing, Reddit and other online sources, 
allows you to rotate them on a regular interval, and provides easy ways to separate the great images from the junk. 
Variety can also display wise and funny quotations or a nice digital clock on the desktop.

Where supported, Variety sits as a tray icon to allow easy pausing and resuming.
Otherwise, its desktop entry menu provides a similar set of options.

If you have added the PPA, you may also install [Variety Slideshow](https://github.com/peterlevi/variety-slideshow) â€“ a pan and zoom image slideshow/screensaver, which is an nice optional addition and integrates well into Variety. It is not available in the standard Ubuntu Universe repository.

```
sudo apt install variety-slideshow
```
