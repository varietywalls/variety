# Variety

Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports numerous desktops
and wallpaper sources, including local files and online services: Flickr,
Wallhaven, Unsplash, and more.

Where supported, Variety sits as a tray icon to allow easy pausing and resuming.
Otherwise, its desktop entry menu provides a similar set of options.

Variety also includes a range of image effects, such as oil painting and blur,
as well as options to layer quotes and a clock onto the background.
