  <summary>Wallpaper changer that automatically downloads wallpapers</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Variety changes the desktop wallpaper on a regular basis, 
        using user-specified or automatically downloaded images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Variety sits conveniently as an indicator in the panel 
        and can be easily paused and resumed. The mouse wheel 
        can be used to scroll wallpapers back and forth until 
        you find the perfect one for your current mood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from displaying images from local folders, several 
        different online sources can be used to fetch wallpapers 
        according to user-specified criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        Variety can also automatically apply various fancy 
        filters to the displayed images - charcoal painting, 
        oil painting, heavy blurring, etc. - so that your 
        desktop is always fresh and unique.
