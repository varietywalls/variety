"Before we start, here are some things you need to be aware of and agree to:\n"
"\n"
"<b>Variety is an open-source application, provided as is, without any "
"warranties</b>. By using it, you agree to the terms and conditions of the <a "

"under which it is distributed.  \n"
"\n"
"<b>Variety is an internet-connected application.</b> With default settings, "
"Variety downloads images from the internet. Web servers it downloads from "
"may collect information about your device, like IP address. Variety does not "
"send any personally identifiable information. By using Variety, you accept "
"its use of internet connectivity. <b>Note that all internet connectivity can "

"\n"
"<b>Variety fetches and applies rate limiting settings defined by the "
"development team.</b> This may affect the rate at which it downloads new "
"images, but it helps ensure Variety can work regardless of how many people "
"are running it. These settings will be downloaded from gist.github.com where "
"we host them.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Some image sources require us to track additional information when "
"enabled.</b> For example the terms of <a href=\"https://help.unsplash.com/en/"
"articles/2511245-unsplash-api-guidelines\">Unsplash</a> require us to track "
