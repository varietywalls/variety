Laws Of Project Management:

   1. No major project is ever installed on time, within budgets, 
      with the staff that started it.  Yours will not be the 
      first.
   2. Projects progress quickly until they become 90 percent 
      complete, then they remain at 90 percent complete forever.
   3. One advantage of fuzzy project objectives is that they let 
      you avoid the embarrassment of estimating the corresponding 
      costs.
   4. When things are going well, something will go wrong. When 
      things just can't get any worse, they will. When things 
      appear to be going better you have overlooked something.
   5. If project content is allowed to change freely, the rate of 
      change will exceed the rate of progress.
   6. No system is ever completely debugged. Attempts to debug a 
      system inevitably introduce new bugs that are even harder 
      to find.
   7. A carelessly planned project will take three times longer 
      to complete than expected; a carefully planned project will 
      take only twice as long.
   8. Project teams detest progress reporting because it vividly 
      manifests their lack of progress.

"...well over half of the time you spend working on a project

 if a tool did everything except the thinking for you -- if it
 wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the 
 documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, 
 put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers -- the best
 you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in

 lubrication where people rub together. Often the very young,
 the untraveled, the naive, the unsophisticated deplore these

"Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test 
 results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves,
 they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by
 increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight
 by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step
 onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the
 software development techniques you use determine how many
 errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't
 buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your
 software, don't test more; develop better."

 There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly 
 half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those 
 who say: this glass is half empty. The world belongs, however, to

 glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don't think so. 
 My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass! Who's been pinching 
 my beer? 
 And at the other end of the bar the world is full of the other 
 type of person, who has a broken glass, or a glass that has been 
 carelessly knocked over (usually by one of the people calling 
 for a larger glass) or who had no glass at all, because he was 
 at the back of the crowd and had failed to catch the barman's 
 eye. "

  Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.
  Elves are terrific. They beget terror.

"He'd noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery: it 
 fascinated people, they sometimes bought books full of 
 complicated recipes and interesting pictures, and sometimes when 
 they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their

 happily for egg and chips. If it was well done and maybe had a 
 slice of tomato."

"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was 
 because they managed to spend less money.

 Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month 
 plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty 
 dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK 
 for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard 
 gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots 
 Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that 
 he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by 
 the feel of the cobbles.

 But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A 
 man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd 
 still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor 
 man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred 
 dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

 This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic 
 unfairness."
 -- Terry Pratchett (Men at Arms)

"Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.

 the truth is Hitler did very little. He was a world class
 asshole, but the evil actually done, from the death camps to
 World War Two, was all done by citizens who were afraid to
 question if what they were told by their government was the

 refused to see the truth behind the Reichstag Fire, refused to
 see the invasion by Poland was a staged fake, and followed
 Hitler into national disaster."

"Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor
 slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he
 can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?
 Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia,
 nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
 understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who
 determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag
 the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist
 dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship...
 Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the
